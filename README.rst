Week 1: Preliminaries
================================================================

*Check correspondent item in Projects board* (`Spring-2018`_)
*once you get something done*.

Prepare your operating system
----------------------------------------------------------------

We use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this project, and any releases with
Ubuntu 16.04 should work, such as ``ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd``,
``Kubuntu 16.04.4 LTS``, ``ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd``.

If you don't have access to a computer with Ubuntu 16.04 and
you don't want to dual boot your current computer,
``VirtualBox`` may be a good alternative.

In this course, you are strongly suggested to get familiar with
using Shell commands in Linux.

Prepare your Python environment
----------------------------------------------------------------

We use Python 3.6 in this project, and the Anaconda release is
recommended (which would significantly reduce your time spent
in setting-up environments).
