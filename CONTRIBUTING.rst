For Members
================================================================================

To commit your code, please follow the steps below:

1. Fork the project;
#. Create a feature branch;
#. Update your branch;
#. Before creating a pull request, make sure that the unit tests are all passed (if any);
#. Create a pull request (following the template).

Once the pull request is opened, I (lukeluochina) would spare time to review
your submitted code, discuss with you the details inside, and possibly ask you
to make modifications. After all problems have been resolved, I would merge the
new feature branch to master branch.
